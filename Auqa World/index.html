                  Betta fish, native to Southeast Asia, are celebrated for their
                  vibrant colors and elaborate, flowing fins, especially in
                  males. They are known for their territorial and aggressive
                  nature, which is why male bettas are typically kept alone.
                  Bettas are <strong>labyrinth fish</strong>.

                  Originating from China, goldfish are one of the most common
                  and oldest domesticated aquarium fish. They belong to the carp
                  family and were first bred for color over a thousand years
                  ago. While wild goldfish are typically a dull grayish-green,
                  selective breeding has created over 125 different varieties.

                  in Southeast Asia in the 1990s. They are a type of cichlid
                  known for their distinctive and large nuchal hump (or "kok")
                  on their forehead, as well as their bright, colorful patterns.

                <p>
                  Hi! I can definitely help you with that. Fish keeping is a
                  fascinating hobby that involves providing a suitable
                  environment for fish to thrive. It requires a lot of care and
                  attention, but the rewards of having a vibrant and healthy
                  aquarium are well worth it.Fish
                  keeping is a rewarding and engaging hobby that requires
                  meticulous attention to the health and well-being of its
                  aquatic inhabitants. A crucial aspect of this is maintaining
                  the correct water temperature, as different species have
                  specific thermal requirements for their metabolism and immune
                  function. Any deviation from their ideal range can cause
                  stress, making them susceptible to disease. Proper nutrition
                  is equally vital; a balanced diet of high-quality flakes,
                  pellets, or frozen foods tailored to the fish's specific
                  dietary needs ensures they receive all the necessary vitamins
                  and nutrients for growth, color, and vitality. Regular
                  observation is key to early detection of health issues, such
                  as changes in behavior, appetite, or the appearance of
                  physical symptoms like fin rot or white spots. Proactive care,
                  including consistent water quality checks and a clean
                  environment, forms the foundation of a healthy and flourishing
                  aquatic ecosystem.

            <h3>Ich (White Spot Disease)</h3>
            <p>
             Ichthyophthirius multifiliis is a highly contagious parasitic infection that appears as tiny white salt-like spots covering the fish's body and fins. This common disease causes fish to scratch against objects and breathe rapidly, thriving in stressful conditions with poor water quality. Treatment involves gradually raising the tank temperature to 86°F (30°C) for 3-5 days combined with ich medication, while improving water conditions through frequent partial water changes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="disease-item">
            <h3>Black Spot Disease</h3>
            <p>
              Caused by parasitic flatworms (trematodes), this condition appears as small black cysts or spots on the skin, fins and gills. The parasites complete their lifecycle through snails and birds, making pond fish particularly vulnerable. Effective treatment includes potassium permanganate baths and removing snails from the environment, along with improving water circulation and quality to prevent reinfection.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="disease-item">
            <h3>Swim Bladder Disorder</h3>
            <p>
             This common condition affects buoyancy control, causing fish to float uncontrollably, sink or swim sideways. Often caused by constipation from overfeeding dry foods, it can also result from infections or physical trauma. Treatment includes fasting for 2-3 days followed by feeding cooked, skinned peas, while severe cases may require antibacterial medication and water parameter adjustments to reduce stress.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="disease-item">
            <h3>Fish Lice (Argulus)</h3>
            <p>
           These visible crustacean parasites (up to 1cm) attach to fish bodies using hook-like appendages, causing irritation, inflammation and secondary infections. Manual removal with tweezers followed by salt dips can eliminate adult lice, while insect growth regulator medications treat younger stages. Quarantining new fish and disinfecting nets between tanks helps prevent outbreaks of these damaging parasites.
